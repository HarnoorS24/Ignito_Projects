    "# Credit Card Fraud Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using transaction data.\n",
    "- Handle a highly imbalanced dataset where fraud is a rare event.\n",
    "- Create new features, including error and ratio-based features, to expose fraudulent patterns.\n",
    "- Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.\n",
    "- Evaluate models using metrics appropriate for imbalanced classification (e.g., Precision, Recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "In the digital economy, the speed and volume of financial transactions present a significant challenge for banks and payment processors in distinguishing legitimate activity from fraud. The ability to detect fraudulent transactions in real-time is crucial for minimizing financial losses, protecting customers, and maintaining trust in the financial system. In the field of data science, anomaly detection and classification models offer a robust tool for sifting through millions of transactions to identify the subtle patterns that signal fraudulent activity. This project leverages a large-scale synthetic dataset based on real-world financial logs to build a model that can identify fraud, enabling a more data-driven and automated approach to transaction security.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Loading in the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will use the [Synthetic Financial Datasets For Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealaxi/paysim1) from Kaggle. In accordance with Kaggle licenses, please directly visit the Kaggle website and download the `PS_20174392719_1491204439457_log.csv` dataset for this activity, and then upload the file to the same directory as the notebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start by loading in the dataset into a pandas dataframe, and then displaying it to ensure it loaded correctly, and so we can see what the features are and how the target is displayed. This means that we have to start by importing pandas as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth mentioning that anytime you have a dataset from an external source, such as Kaggle, you can and should refer back to the source of the data to clear up misconceptions and also to get a better understanding of the data."

    "* `step`: An integer representing a unit of time, where 1 step equals 1 hour. The dataset covers a total of 744 steps, equivalent to a 30-day simulation.\n",
    "* `type`: The type of transaction. This is a categorical feature with five possible values: 'CASH-IN', 'CASH-OUT', 'DEBIT', 'PAYMENT', and 'TRANSFER'.\n",
    "* `amount`: A numerical value representing the total amount of the transaction in the local currency.\n",
    "* `nameOrig`: The identifier for the customer who initiated the transaction. This is a categorical feature.\n",
    "* `oldbalanceOrg`: The initial balance of the originator's account before the transaction occurred.\n",
    "* `newbalanceOrig`: The balance of the originator's account after the transaction was completed.\n",
    "* `nameDest`: The identifier for the recipient of the transaction. This is a categorical feature.\n",
    "* `oldbalanceDest`: The initial balance of the recipient's account before the transaction.\n",
    "* `newbalanceDest`: The balance of the recipient's account after the transaction.\n",
    "* `isFraud`: The target variable. A binary flag where `1` indicates the transaction was fraudulent and `0` indicates it was legitimate.\n",

    "\n",
    "To prepare our data for the machine learning model, we need to handle our categorical features. Our primary focus will be the `type` column, which contains text values like 'CASH_OUT' and 'TRANSFER'. Since machine learning algorithms require numerical inputs to perform mathematical operations, we must convert these categories into a numerical format. We will accomplish this using **one-hot encoding**, which creates new binary columns for each transaction type. This method effectively represents the category of a transaction without creating a false or misleading ordinal relationship between the different types, ensuring our model can interpret the data correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will drop the `nameOrig` and `nameDest` columns because they contain millions of unique customer IDs, making them high-cardinality features. Encoding these is computationally impractical and would cause the model to simply memorize individual users rather than learn the general patterns of fraudulent transactions. By removing them, we force the model to focus on the transactional data itself, which is a more robust and effective approach. Essentially, we'll be focusing on common patterns of fraud as opposed to what might not be in line for a specific person. This is effective since there are often similar patterns to fraud, and since it is difficult to get precise purchasing information due to privacy, security, and legal reasons.\n",

    "\n",
    "To improve our model's ability to detect fraud, our next step is feature engineering. The goal is to create new data points that highlight the unusual mathematical signatures of fraudulent transactions, making these rare events stand out more clearly from normal activity. We'll accomplish this by creating error features that calculate the discrepancy between the expected account balance and the actual final balance after a transaction. We will also create ratio features, such as dividing the transaction `amount` by the account's original balance, to contextualize the transaction's size relative to the account's history.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we'll extract time-based features from the `step` column. Since each step represents one hour, we can calculate the `hour_of_day` for each transaction to help the model learn if fraudulent activities occur more frequently at specific times, like late at night. These engineered features provide crucial behavioral context that isn't available in the raw data, giving our anomaly detection model a much stronger signal to learn from."

    "With our data now split and scaled, we will perform **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** as the final step before modeling. PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique used to distill a large set of features into a smaller, more efficient set of new features called principal components. We are doing this to reduce the complexity of our dataset, which can help our model train faster and sometimes perform better by removing redundant information and noise. It is essential that we apply PCA *after* scaling because the algorithm works by identifying the directions of maximum variance, and it would be biased by features with large, arbitrary scales if the data were not first standardized. To implement this, we will use Sklearn's PCA to analyze our scaled training data and transform our extensive feature set into a smaller number of principal components that still capture the vast majority of the original information."

    "It's worth noting that in addition to dimensionality reduction, PCA serves a crucial secondary purpose in industries like banking: data privacy and anonymization. The process transforms concrete, sensitive features like account balances into a new set of abstract, mathematical components that are not directly human-readable. This allows an organization to share a feature-rich dataset for modeling and analysis without exposing the raw, private customer information, making PCA a powerful tool for both simplifying data and securing it. This is actually part of the reason we are using a synthetic dataset for this project. Most of the uploaded banking datasets already have PCA applied for privacy and security purposes, so by grabbing a synthetic dataset like this, we're able to practice applying PCA ourselves.\n",

    "## 7. Data Balancing\n",
    "\n",
    "As this project is designed for learning, training a model on the full six million rows can be computationally intensive for a standard laptop. This dataset also presents a severe class imbalance, with fraudulent transactions being extremely rare. Therefore, we'll address both issues at once by creating a smaller, perfectly balanced training subsample.\n",
    "\n",
    "To increase the representation of our rare fraud cases, we'll use an advanced oversampling technique called **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)**. Instead of simply duplicating existing fraud data, SMOTE intelligently creates new, artificial fraud samples by generating data points along the line segments that connect real fraud cases. This results in a richer, more diverse set of fraud examples for our model to learn from without creating exact copies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, to handle the overwhelmingly large 'non-fraud' class, we'll use **random undersampling**. This technique works by simply removing random samples from the majority class until its size is reduced to a more manageable number. The main benefit is that it significantly speeds up training time and prevents the model from being biased by the sheer volume of non-fraudulent examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "To combine these two methods in a clean way (and to save us some trouble), we'll use a pipeline object from the imblearn library. A pipeline is an object that chains multiple data processing steps together into a single workflow. This ensures that our oversampling and undersampling steps are applied in the correct sequence automatically, preventing logical errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our specific strategy will be to use the pipeline to first apply SMOTE to increase the number of fraud cases to a more substantial level, and then immediately apply random undersampling to reduce the number of non-fraud cases to match. This hybrid approach gives us the best of both worlds: a perfectly balanced dataset that is large enough to learn from but small enough to train on efficiently."

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confusion Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix reveals how well the Random Forest model differentiates between legitimate transactions (class 0) and fraudulent ones (class 1), which is critical in a real-world fraud detection scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model demonstrates well overall performance. It correctly identifies 1,267,874 legitimate transactions and 1,439 fraudulent ones. However, it does misclassify 2,960 legitimate transactions as fraudulent (false positives) and misses 251 fraud cases (false negatives). Given the sheer volume of class 0 examples, this outcome represents a significant achievement in model sensitivity, especially for the rare class 1 events.\n",
    "\n",
    "These results highlight a model that is both cautious and effective. While it produces some false alarms, its ability to catch a large proportion of actual fraud cases signals a strong fit for high-risk financial applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification Report\n",
    "\n",
    "The model’s performance metrics provide further insight into this tradeoff:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Precision**:\n",
    "  For legitimate transactions (class 0), the model achieves a perfect precision of 1.00, meaning it nearly never falsely labels a fraudulent transaction as legitimate. For fraudulent transactions (class 1), the precision drops to 0.33, indicating that while the model catches many frauds, it also flags a notable number of legitimate transactions as suspicious. This is expected and acceptable in fraud detection, where it is better to be cautious.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Recall**:\n",
    "  Recall for class 0 is again nearly perfect at 1.00, showing that almost every non-fraudulent transaction is correctly identified. More importantly, the recall for class 1 reaches 0.85, meaning the model successfully identifies 85% of fraudulent transactions. This high recall rate is essential in fraud detection, where the cost of missing fraudulent activity can be far greater than dealing with false alarms.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **F1-score**:\n",
    "  The F1-score balances the tradeoff between precision and recall. For class 0, the score remains perfect at 1.00. For class 1, the F1-score is 0.47, reflecting moderate effectiveness in balancing precision and recall for fraudulent transactions. This performance is strong given the extreme class imbalance and high-stakes context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Macro averages show reasonable balance between the classes, with values of 0.66 (precision), 0.92 (recall), and 0.74 (F1). The weighted averages remain high due to the overwhelming presence of class 0, but they confirm that the model is not neglecting the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest model proves to be a highly effective fraud detection tool in this case. Despite the skewed dataset, it achieves an overall accuracy of 99.75% while maintaining a strong recall of 0.85 on the minority class. This means the model is able to identify most fraudulent transactions while keeping false negatives to a minimum.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of credit card fraud, this kind of performance is not only acceptable, it is desirable. The cost of a false positive (flagging a legitimate transaction as fraud) typically results in a brief inconvenience for the customer, such as a declined charge or a verification step. On the other hand, the cost of a false negative (failing to catch actual fraud) can result in significant financial loss, reputational damage, and downstream risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why high recall on the fraud class is more important than high precision. Catching more fraud, even if it means incorrectly flagging some legitimate transactions, can be quickly managed through manual review or automated checks. In contrast, failing to detect fraud has much more severe consequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model delivers on that principle. With a recall of 0.85 on fraudulent transactions and the robustness of ensemble learning behind it, the Random Forest model stands out as a strong candidate for deployment in a real-world fraud detection pipeline. Note however that in a real world scenario, you'll likely have more data to work with, as well as a stronger machine. For an educational project, this teaches the techniques necessary to detect fraud, but there is still room to improve and alter the model specifically to catch more fraud in real world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Great job reaching this point in the project. You not only tackled an imbalanced and challenging dataset, but you also applied advanced techniques like SMOTE and performed a thorough evaluation across meaningful metrics. This is a well-executed step toward mastering classification problems in real-world, high-impact domains. Give yourself a pat on the back."
