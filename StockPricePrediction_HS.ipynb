    "# Stock Price Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Goals\n",
    "- Predict the future price of a stock using its historical data.\n",
    "- Create lag features, rolling averages, and moving window statistics to capture time-series patterns\n",
    "- Apply feature scaling (standardization) to prepare data for modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "Financial markets are a cornerstone of the global economy, and predicting stock price movements is a notoriously challenging and highly sought-after goal for investors and financial institutions. Stock prices are not random; they are a form of time-series data where future values are dependent on past values, trends, and volatility. In the field of data science, time-series analysis provides a framework for tackling this problem. By engineering features that capture historical patterns, such as lag features (past prices) and rolling statistics (moving averages), we can transform a sequence of prices into a format suitable for machine learning. This project leverages historical price data for the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) to build a forecasting model, providing a hands-on introduction to time-series feature engineering and prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Loading in the Data\n",
    "For this project, we will use the yfinance Python library to programmatically download historical stock price data for the S&P 500 ETF (ticker: SPY). Instead of manually downloading a file, we will write a short script to fetch this data and save it locally as spy_data.csv. his is a common and reproducible method in data science. If you haven't installed the library, you can do so by running pip install yfinance in your terminal. This tool allows us to pull clean, up-to-date data directly from Yahoo Finance.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will write a short script to download the complete historical data for the S&P 500 ETF (ticker: SPY) and load it directly into a pandas DataFrame. This requires us to import both the yfinance and pandas libraries at the start of our notebook. We'll also take the liberty of saving this data to a csv so as to not have to download the data each time we need to run the code. The following code will fetch the data and prepare it for our use."

For this purpose, we will use the Close price, as it is the standard benchmark that reflects the market's final consensus on the stock's value after a full day of trading. To frame this as a predictive task, we will create a new 'Target' column by shifting the Close price column backwards by one day. This operation effectively sets the target for any given row to be the actual closing price of the following trading day, establishing the direct relationship our model needs to learn.

    "As we move into the final stage of our preprocessing for now, we will focus on feature engineering. This is the process of creating new, predictive features from our existing data, which is absolutely essential for any time-series forecasting model. Our goal is to transform our single column of historical prices into a rich dataset where each row contains a wealth of context that our model can use to make a prediction. To do this, we will craft features that describe the stock's recent behavior, including its momentum and volatility, giving our model the historical perspective it needs.\n",

    "Specifically, we will engineer two main types of features. First, we will create lag features, which are simply the price or return values from previous days (such as the price from 1 day ago, 3 days ago, etc.). This directly feeds the model information about recent price action. Second, we will generate rolling window statistics, such as moving averages and standard deviations, over various periods (like 5, 30, and 200 days). A moving average helps the model identify the underlying trend, while a rolling standard deviation provides a crucial measure of recent volatility. \n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a closer look at how our linear regression model performed in predicting stock prices. Unlike more complex ensemble approaches or models that rely on multiple transformations or feature interactions, we opted for a straightforward linear regression model. This choice was guided by the simplicity of our dataset and the goal of building an interpretable baseline for stock price forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results suggest that our model performed remarkably well. We achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of approximately $4.78, which means that, on average, our predictions differ from the actual stock prices by just under five dollars. The Mean Absolute Error (MAE) came in at about $3.24, providing a measure of the typical absolute error between predicted and actual values without disproportionately penalizing larger deviations. Together, these two metrics give us confidence that our model's predictions are not only consistent but reasonably accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most notably, our model achieved an R² score of 0.9977, indicating that it explains over 99.7% of the variation in stock prices within our dataset. This is an exceptionally strong result for a linear model, and it suggests that the linear relationships captured by our features are highly predictive of the target variable. While R² is not the only measure of success, such a high value indicates that very little variance remains unexplained by our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we only used a single model and kept the architecture simple, the results speak for themselves. The low error values and high R² score show that linear regression, when paired with relevant and clean features, can still offer powerful predictive capabilities. It's a strong reminder that in many cases, simpler models can be both effective and interpretable, a valuable combination in both academic and practical settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Throughout this project, we carefully guided the SPY dataset through every stage of the time-series forecasting pipeline, from programmatic data acquisition to specialized feature engineering and the final evaluation of our regression model. By handling time-aware data, creating lag and rolling window features to capture trends and volatility, and implementing a leak-proof chronological split, we prepared our data to reveal the patterns that drive short-term price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the value of this process goes beyond predicting stock prices alone. Building and refining time-series models teaches us how to find predictive signals in sequential data, transforming a simple list of prices into insights that can inform decisions in fields like finance, economics, and inventory management. The methods we used here, such as creating stationary features from non-stationary data and correctly splitting data chronologically, are essential not only for coursework but for tackling real-world forecasting challenges where accuracy and robust methodology matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "By practicing data preparation, thoughtful time-series feature engineering, and a rigorous evaluation of our model, we have built a solid foundation for tackling future forecasting tasks. These same skills apply across nearly every area of data science, whether we are forecasting sales, predicting patient vitals, or modeling climate data. For now, good work, and give yourself a pat on the back."
