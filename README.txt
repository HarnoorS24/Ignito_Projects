This repository consists of a series of projects i am working on for the duration of summer 2025. Mainly meant for learning how code can be used in data analysis. I hope it helps. 
Note that all files are in jupyter notebook format. This means it has some markdown sections, typically to explain the code and what we're doing, and code segments. 
I use python for all code segments unless I specify otherwise in the project.
Though I try not to mention previous projects, the projects are meant to be viewed in a specific order. For the projects I uploaded all at once, start with:
1. Titanic, 2. Housing Prices, 3. Iris Flower, 4. Diabetes Prediction.
After viewing these four projects, try to go in order of release. Newer projects are planned to be a bit more advanced is all. 
Maybe will organize this better in the future.
