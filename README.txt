This repository consists of a series of projects i am working on for the duration of summer 2025. Mainly meant for learning how code can be used in data analysis. I hope it helps. 
Note that all files are in jupyter notebook format. This means it has some markdown sections, typically to explain the code and what we're doing, and code segments. 
I use python for all code segments unless I specify otherwise in the project.
