    "# Customer Churn Prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocessing\n",
    "    - Label encode categorical features to convert them into machine-readable form.\n",
    "    - Engineer new time-based features \n",
    "    - Apply log transformation to skewed numerical features (like total charges) to help the model better understand the data.\n",
    "- Predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographic and usage data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer churn is a significant concern for businesses across many industries, as losing existing customers can have a major impact on revenue and growth. Understanding and predicting why customers leave is a key focus for data-driven organizations aiming to improve retention and sustain long-term success. In the field of data science, predictive modeling enables companies to identify customers who are at risk of leaving (often referred to as “churn\") by analyzing patterns in demographic information, account tenure, and usage behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data Loading \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we will use the [Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn), a widely used collection of customer records from a telecommunications company, which is perfect for our goals. In accordance with Kaggle licenses, please directly visit the Kaggle website and download the `WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` dataset for this activity.  The name is a little long, so feel free to rename it if that's more convienient. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can start by loading in the dataset into a pandas dataframe, and then displaying it to ensure it loaded correctly, and so we can see what the features are and how the target is displayed. This means that we have to start by importing pandas as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth mentioning that anytime you have a dataset from an external source, such as Kaggle, you can and should refer back to the source of the data to clear up misconceptions and also to get a better understanding of the data."

    "### Encoding Categorical Features\n",
    "\n",
    "To prepare our dataset for machine learning, we’ll encode all categorical features into a numerical format, ensuring that our predictive models can process the data effectively. Many machine learning algorithms require numeric input, so any columns containing text or categories must be transformed. For binary features, such as those with “Yes” or “No” responses, we’ll use label encoding, which assigns a unique number to each category (for example, “Yes” becomes 1 and “No” becomes 0). For features with more than two possible categories, such as “Contract Type” or “Payment Method,” we’ll use one-hot encoding, creating separate columns for each unique value and indicating presence with a 1 or 0. We can easily accomplish this step using pandas get_dummies() function. By converting all categorical variables to a numeric format, we ensure our dataset is ready for modeling and avoid introducing unintended relationships between categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that some columns, like multipleLines, seem binary at first glance, but are actually not. As such, be careful with which features you encode, and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, inspecting the dataset, there is a binary feature, senior citizen, which is already in a numerical binary format. It's an example fo why you should always view and analyze your data before going ahead with processing it. To be safe, we can check if it is considered an integer, or if it is a number in a string format, and deal with it accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by encoding the categorical binary features, and then one-hot encoding the remaining features."

In churn prediction, how long a customer has been with the company can tell us a lot about their risk of leaving. The “tenure” column already gives us the number of months each customer has stayed. We can build on this by creating features like a “new” customer flag for those who have just joined, and a “long_tenure” flag for customers who have been with the company for a longer period. These new features help our model pick up on loyalty patterns and identify which groups are most likely to churn, making our predictions more meaningful.\n",

By fitting these transformations on the training set and then applying them to the test set, we make sure that no information from the test data sneaks into the training process. This keeps our evaluation fair and realistic, helping us build a model that will generalize well to new, unseen customers.\n",

Log transformation helps reduce the impact of these outliers and makes the data easier for the model to interpret. To do this, we’ll import the FunctionTransformer from Sklearn, fit it on the training set, and then use it to transform both the train and test data, ensuring our process is robust and free from data leakage.\n",

Logistic regression is a linear model that predicts the probability of churn using a weighted combination of all our features. It is interpretable and can show us which features are most strongly associated with customers leaving. Random forests, on the other hand, are an ensemble of decision trees that can capture more complex and nonlinear relationships in the data. They are generally less sensitive to outliers and can often achieve higher accuracy on structured datasets like ours. For the sake of comparing and learning, we will train both models and see how their predictions and performance measure up, helping us understand the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.\n",

    "### Metrics Overview\n",
    "Before diving into the results, it’s helpful to clarify what each metric means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy reflects the proportion of all predictions that the model got right.\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision measures how often the model’s positive predictions (predicting a customer will churn) are correct.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall tells us how well the model finds all the actual churners in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing the trade-off between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support simply counts the number of samples in each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix visually breaks down how the model classified each group, highlighting both successes and errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confusion Matrix\n",
    "The confusion matrices for both models show how well each approach distinguishes between customers who stayed (class 0) and those who churned (class 1). For logistic regression, the model correctly predicted 935 customers who stayed and 201 who churned, but also misclassified 98 customers who stayed as churners, and missed 175 true churners. The random forest model shows similar patterns, with 921 correct predictions for non-churners and 179 for churners, while making more errors for both types: 112 false positives and 197 missed churners. Both models are clearly more effective at recognizing customers who stayed, but have more difficulty correctly identifying those who will actually churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification Report\n",
    "Precision, recall, and F1-score shed further light on each model’s strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision: For customers who stayed (class 0), both models are relatively strong (0.84 for logistic regression and 0.82 for random forest), meaning most “no churn” predictions are correct. Precision for churners (class 1) is lower, 0.67 for logistic regression and 0.62 for random forest, indicating both models generate a fair number of false alarms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall: Logistic regression achieves a recall of 0.91 for class 0, showing it successfully identifies the vast majority of customers who stayed. For churners, recall drops to 0.53, suggesting nearly half of actual churners are missed. Random forest is slightly lower, with recall values of 0.89 for class 0 and just 0.48 for class 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "- F1-score: The F1-scores for non-churners are higher for both models (0.87 for logistic regression, 0.86 for random forest), but for churners, the scores are noticeably lower (0.60 and 0.54, respectively), reinforcing that both models struggle with identifying churners as effectively as non-churners.\n",
    "\n",
    "The macro and weighted averages for all metrics hover in the 0.70–0.80 range, indicating moderate overall balance in classification but with a clear drop-off in performance for the minority class.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overall Analysis\n",
    "Accuracy for logistic regression is about 0.81, slightly higher than random forest at 0.78. While both models perform well in classifying customers who stayed, they struggle to catch churners, with lower recall and F1-scores for class 1. The models tend to be conservative, more likely to classify a customer as staying rather than churning. This reflects a common challenge in churn prediction, where imbalanced datasets and subtle churn patterns make it difficult to catch every customer at risk of leaving.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results suggest that logistic regression holds a slight edge over random forest for this specific dataset, offering better recall and F1-score for churners, although both models are far from perfect. In a real-world setting, you might want to experiment with techniques to boost recall for churn (such as adjusting class weights, resampling, or fine-tuning hyperparameters) in order to identify more customers at risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing both models side by side not only helps us understand their strengths and weaknesses, but also highlights the value of evaluating models beyond simple accuracy. As with any predictive modeling project, this experience reinforces the importance of careful preprocessing, thorough evaluation, and continual improvement in pursuit of actionable business insights. Or for the sake of learning the techniques. Whatever may be your reason for following along, hopefully, this all helped.\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on reaching this point in the project and gaining a deeper understanding of model comparison and churn prediction!"
