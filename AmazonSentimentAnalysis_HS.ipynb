    "# Amazon Review Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Goals\n",
    "- Predict whether an Amazon review has a positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "- Convert unstructured text data into meaningful numerical features.\n",
    "    - Clean and preprocess raw text from reviews.\n",
    "    - Apply TF-IDF vectorization to represent the text data.\n",
    "- Explore word-level features to understand what drives sentiment.\n",
    "- Compare and analyze results from two different classification models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context\n",
    "In the modern digital marketplace, customer reviews are a cornerstone of consumer decision-making and a vital source of feedback for businesses. Understanding the sentiment expressed in these reviews at a large scale presents a significant challenge. Automatically classifying reviews as positive or negative is crucial for businesses to gauge customer satisfaction, identify product strengths and weaknesses, and manage their brand reputation. In the field of data science, Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers a robust toolkit for converting unstructured text into features for predictive modeling. This project leverages a real-world dataset of past Amazon reviews to build a classification model that predicts sentiment, enabling a more data-driven approach to understanding the voice of the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Loading in the Data\n",
    "For this project, we will use the [Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews?select=Reviews.csv) from Kaggle. In accordance with Kaggle licenses, please directly visit the Kaggle website and download the `Reviews.csv` dataset for this activity, and then upload the file to the same directory as the notebook file.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can start by loading in the dataset into a pandas dataframe, and then displaying it to ensure it loaded correctly, and so we can see what the features are and how the target is displayed. This means that we have to start by importing pandas as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth mentioning that anytime you have a dataset from an external source, such as Kaggle, you can and should refer back to the source of the data to clear up misconceptions and also to get a better understanding of the data."

Thankfully, pandas has plenty of tools for us to use to check if we have any null values. Something to note is that since we are handling a lot of text, there is a chance that instead of being considered null in the data, it might just be a blank string. As such, we'll check for blank strings as well. We'll use a bit more code than usual for this, so do follow along.\n",

    "### Removing Nuetrality \n",
    "Removing reviews with a 3-star rating is a deliberate strategic decision to improve the quality and clarity of our data. These neutral reviews are often ambiguous, containing a mix of positive and negative language that makes it difficult for a model to learn a clear signal. By dropping them, we create a distinct binary problem with clearly positive (4-5 stars) and clearly negative (1-2 stars) classes. While this does reduce the overall quantity of our data, it significantly improves the quality, which allows models using techniques like Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF to more easily identify the words and phrases strongly associated with each sentiment, leading to a more robust and better-performing final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that while this simplification is a great technique for building a strong binary classifier, it isn't always the right approach. For more complex, real-world applications, keeping the neutral class can provide a more nuanced understanding of customer feedback. In those cases, it would be ideal to use a more advanced model, such as a neural network, which is better equipped to handle the subtlety and complexity of a three-class (positive, neutral, negative) sentiment problem. For our current purpose of learning TF-IDF later on, however, the binary approach is better suited.\n",

    "While not obvious from simply inspecting the dataframe as we have done so far, looking at the Kaggle documentation for this dataset reveals that even though we have over 500,000 rows, we only had 393579 unique reviews. Without reviews scored at 3 stars, this number is likely even lower. On Amazon, certain products are bunched together, typically by brand as a different version of the same product. Any reviews on one of those products are also visible on a different version of the same product, which is likely what is causing our duplication issue. For the sake of our model reading everything properly, we'll be filtering out these duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, our work is cut out for us, as pandas does have a drop_duplicates function that does exactly what we need it to. We'll be specifying the columns when we use this function as well, since the review, time, profile, and user Id are all likely duplicates, features like the product Id are likely to be unique all throughout."

Features such as the Id's and the profile name are likely not going to help our model learn the data. In fact, it might even cause data leakage, as it can assume that if a person or item tends to have negative or positive reviews, it can then guess based on either the person or item. When confronted with a new item being reveiwed by a new person, then it'll have trouble making a proper prediction.\n",

    "\n",

    "## 3. Text Cleaning \n",
    "\n",
    "The next essential step in our project is to perform text cleaning. The main goal here is to standardize our raw review text by removing all the noise that doesn't help in determining sentiment. This ensures that when our model analyzes the data, it focuses only on what's important. If we feed it messy data, we'll get a messy, unreliable model. To do this, we'll create a single function that performs a few key cleaning steps on each review. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for this function we'll be combining our summary and text features, as while summary may not contain many words, the few words that are contained end up being impactful. We'll be applying the same cleaning strategy to the combined feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it will remove any stray HTML tags. While it might seem odd to check for such things in Amazon reviews, there's a chance that the webscraper or whatever tool used to collect the reviews did so by pulling in the raw HTML data that contained the text. This might be something like `<br />` to signify a paragraph break on the review in the website. We might not have directly seen any HTML tags, but this is a good check to have.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, it will convert all text to lowercase so that words like \"Good\", \"good\", and \"GOOD\" are treated as the same word. It will also strip out all punctuation so that words like \"bad\" and \"bad!\" are also treated the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically this process would also include dealing with \"stop words\", which are common, unimportant words such as \"the\", \"a\", \"is\", and \"in\". This would allow the model to pay attention to more meaningful words. However, and fortunately for us, the skicit-learn library has a list of stop words saved for this exact reason, so we won't have to worry about getting those right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our cleaning function, we'll also import Python's built-in re module to handle tasks that require Regular Expressions, often called \"regex.\" Think of regex as a powerful tool for finding and replacing specific patterns within text, much like a supercharged \"Find & Replace.\" We use it for two key jobs: first, to instantly find and remove any HTML tags by searching for the pattern of text enclosed in angle brackets. Second, we use it to strip out all punctuation by searching for any character that is not a letter and replacing it with a space. Using the re module is the most efficient and reliable way to handle these specific cleaning needs."

    "With our data cleaned and split, we can now proceed to the most critical step of our NLP pipeline: feature extraction. This is the process where we will finally convert our cleaned review text into a numerical format that a machine learning model can understand and learn from. For this project, as outlined in our goals, we will be using a powerful and standard technique called TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).\n",

    "TF-IDF is an intelligent way to represent text that goes beyond simply counting how many times a word appears. It works by calculating a score for each word in each review, a score that reflects how important that word is to that specific document. This is done by balancing two metrics: Term Frequency (TF), which is how often a word appears in a single review, and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), which lowers the score for words that are very common across all reviews (like \"and\" or \"it\") and boosts the score for words that are rare and more descriptive. The result is a numerical feature for each word that effectively represents its importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our plan is to use the TfidfVectorizer from the Sklearn library to implement this. It's crucial that we perform this step correctly to avoid data leakage: we will fit the vectorizer only on our training data to learn the vocabulary and word importances, and then use that same fitted vectorizer to transform both our training and test sets into numerical matrices. By setting parameters like `max_features`, we can also control the size of our vocabulary to keep our model efficient and focused on only the most relevant terms. Another parameter we'll use is `stop_words`, which we mentioned before will deal with incredibly common words like \"the\".\n",

    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confusion Matrix\n",
    "The confusion matrices for both models show how well each approach distinguishes between negative reviews (class 0) and positive reviews (class 1). For logistic regression, the model correctly predicted 10114 negative reviews and 10061 positive reviews, but also misclassified 1308 negative reviews as positive, and 1361 positive reviews as negative. The random forest model follows a similar pattern, with 9875 correct predictions for negative reviews and 9667 for positive, while making more errors overall: 1547 false positives and 1755 missed positive reviews. Both models show strong performance overall, though logistic regression appears more balanced and slightly more accurate in distinguishing sentiment polarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Classification Report\n",
    "Precision, recall, and F1-score offer additional insight into the models’ respective strengths:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Precision: For negative reviews (class 0), both models are strong, with precision at 0.88 for logistic regression and 0.85 for random forest, indicating that most negative predictions are indeed correct. The same holds true for positive reviews (class 1), with precision at 0.88 for logistic regression and 0.86 for random forest. This reflects consistent confidence across both classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recall: Logistic regression achieves nearly identical recall for both classes, at 0.89 for negatives and 0.88 for positives, suggesting the model is adept at correctly identifying both types of sentiment. Random forest lags slightly behind, with 0.86 recall for negative reviews and 0.85 for positive reviews, showing a minor dip in its ability to recognize the true class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- F1-score: F1-scores are evenly matched between the two classes in both models. Logistic regression yields an F1-score of 0.88 across the board, showing balanced precision and recall. Random forest, while slightly lower at 0.86, still maintains respectable performance. The consistency across precision, recall, and F1 in logistic regression indicates stronger overall robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The macro and weighted averages mirror these findings, hovering around 0.88 for logistic regression and 0.86 for random forest. This suggests that class imbalance is not an issue (thanks to our prior balancing), and that performance is uniform across both sentiment categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall Analysis\n",
    "Validation accuracy for logistic regression stands at about 0.88, slightly outperforming random forest at 0.86. While both models are strong performers, logistic regression shows better balance, fewer errors, and slightly stronger classification power. The close alignment of its precision, recall, and F1-score for both classes makes it particularly reliable. In contrast, the random forest model, while still highly capable, makes more mistakes and shows slightly lower consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the size of the dataset and the nature of the task, logistic regression emerges as a well-suited baseline model. Its solid performance, combined with efficiency and interpretability, makes it a great choice for binary sentiment analysis. In a practical setting, one could consider further tuning the models, adding feature engineering, or exploring more advanced architectures like neural nets if higher performance is needed. But for many use cases, this level of accuracy and stability is already actionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing both models highlights not only their strengths and limitations, but also underscores the value of using multiple metrics beyond accuracy. Whether you’re looking to understand product sentiment, streamline customer feedback, or just explore the world of natural language processing, these results are a strong foundation to build on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Exploring Word Level Features \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have confirmed that our models are performing well, we can move beyond simply measuring their predictive accuracy to understanding how they arrive at their conclusions. The next logical step is to explore the word-level features that the model identified as the most powerful predictors of sentiment. The primary reason for this analysis is interpretability; we want to validate that the model is learning logical patterns from the text and gain direct insight into the specific language that drives positive and negative reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, we will inspect our trained Logistic Regression model, as it is highly transparent, especially compared to our Random Forest. This model assigns a numerical weight, or coefficient, to every word in the vocabulary created by our TF-IDF vectorizer. By extracting and ranking these coefficients, we can create a definitive list of the words with the strongest positive weights (the top predictors of a positive review) and those with the strongest negative weights (the top predictors of a negative review). This process effectively allows us to translate the model's internal logic into a clear and actionable analysis of customer sentiment.\n",

    "### Analysis of Word-Level Features\n",
    "An inspection of the model's learned coefficients provides powerful validation for our entire pipeline. The lists of the most influential words for both positive and negative sentiment align perfectly with human intuition, which gives us high confidence that the model has learned meaningful patterns from the text data rather than relying on noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For negative reviews, the model identified words like worst, disappointing, awful, and terrible as the strongest predictors. The inclusion of more specific, product-related terms such as bland, stale, and tasteless, as well as action-oriented words like return and threw, further demonstrates the model's ability to grasp the nuances of customer dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conversely, the top positive words are dominated by superlatives and enthusiastic descriptors. Words like great, delicious, best, perfect, and excellent were assigned the highest positive weights, clearly signaling strong customer satisfaction. The presence of words like love, favorite, and pleasantly reinforces the model's successful identification of positive emotional language. The fact that the model learned these word associations on its own is a testament to the effectiveness of the TF-IDF feature extraction and the robustness of the classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "This analysis is far more than just an academic exercise, as it provides actionable business intelligence. A company could use these insights in several key ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automated Customer Support: The sentiment model could be used to automatically tag and route incoming customer feedback. A review containing words with strong negative weights could be immediately flagged and sent to a support team for priority follow-up, enabling proactive customer service.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Product Development Insights: By analyzing the most common negative keywords (e.g., bland, stale), a company can identify specific, recurring issues with their products and direct their quality assurance or product development teams to address them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Marketing and Voice of Customer Analysis: The top positive keywords provide a clear picture of what customers value most. A marketing team could leverage this language, using words like delicious or perfect in their campaigns, knowing that these terms resonate strongly with their satisfied customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Congratulations on reaching the end of this project! You have successfully navigated a complete Natural Language Processing pipeline, from handling a large, messy, real-world dataset to performing sophisticated text cleaning and feature extraction. You've built and evaluated multiple models and, most importantly, have interpreted their internal logic to extract meaningful, actionable insights. This project demonstrates a deep understanding of both the technical and analytical skills required for sentiment analysis. Job well done!"
